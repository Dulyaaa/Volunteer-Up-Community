# "Volunteer Up Community" To Protect The World 🌏🙌

Every day, when I am stepped out of the house, I see so many people and the environment, that need the help of youth citizens like me. So I gave a thought on this special opportunity to build this platform called "**Volunteer Up Community**" where the people can volunteer to help each other and make a beautiful world.

> _POV: Some volunteering platforms have limitations. Overcoming those limitations is the major aspect since this is a free open source project that anybody can contribute to and access from anywhere._

However, this platform displays the volunteering events that have been created by one of the volunteers to gather the other volunteers too. Event details like the place are mentioned separately. To create the events the volunteer must register and log into the system. Because always be sure to provide the true information. So I used JWT to keep the system information secure.

 # Redis Analytics Bitmaps demo

## How it works
### How the data is stored:

* The event data is stored in various keys and various data types.
    * For each of time spans:
        * year: like 2021
        * month: like 2021-03 (means March of 2021)
        * day: like 2021-03-03 (means 3rd March of 2021)
        * weekOfMonth: like 2021-03/4 (means 4th week of March 2021)
        * anytime
        
    * and for each of scopes:
        * source
        * action
        * source + action
        * action + page
        * userId + action
        * global
        
    * and for each of data types (types):
        * count (Integer stored as String)
        * bitmap
        * set
        
Is generated key like: `rab:{type}[:custom:{customName}][:user:{userId}][:source:{source}][:action:{action}][:page:{page}]:timeSpan:{timeSpan}`, where values in `[]` are optional.
* For each generated key like `rab:count:*`, data is stored like: `INCR {key}`
    * E.g `INCR rab:count:action:addToCart:timeSpan:2015-12/3`
* For each generated key like: `rab:set:*`, data is stored like: `SADD {key} {userId}`
    * E.g `SADD rab:set:action:addToCart:timeSpan:2015-12/3 8`
* For each generated key like `rab:bitmap:*`, data is stored like: `SETBIT {key} {userId} 1`.
    * E.g `SETBIT rab:bitmap:action:addToCart:timeSpan:2015-12/3 8 1`
* Cohort data:
    * We store users who register and then bought some products (action order matters).
    * For each buy action in December we check if user performed register action before (register counter must be greater than zero).
    * If so, we set user bit to 1 like: `SETBIT rab:bitmap:custom:cohort-buy:timeSpan:{timeSpan} {userId} 1`
    * E.g User Id 2 bought 2 products on 2015-12-17. He won't be stored.
    * E.g User Id 10 bought 1 product on 2015-12-17 and registered on 2015-12-16. He will be stored like: `SETBIT rab:bitmap:custom:cohort-buy:timeSpan:2015-12 10 1`.
    * We assume that user cannot buy without register.
* Retention data:
    * Retention means users who bought on two different dates
    * For each buy action we check if user bought more products anytime than bought on particular day (current purchase not included).
    * If so, we add user id to set like: `SADD rab:set:custom:retention-buy:timeSpan:{timeSpan} {userId}`
    * E.g User Id 5 bought 3 products on 2015-12-15. His retention won't be stored (products bought on particular day: 2, products bought anytime: 0).
    * E.g User Id 3 bought 1 product on 2015-12-15 and before - 1 product on 2015-12-13. His retention will be stored (products bought on particular day: 0, products bought anytime: 1) like: `SADD rab:set:custom:retention-buy:timeSpan:2015-12 3`.

### How the data is accessed:

* Total Traffic: 
    * December: `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:custom:global:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * X week of December: `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:custom:global:timeSpan:2015-12/{X}`
        * E.g `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:custom:global:timeSpan:2015-12/3`

* Traffic per Page ({page} is one of: homepage, product1, product2, product3):
    * December: `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:page:{page}:timeSpan:2015-12`

    * X week of December: `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:page:{page}:timeSpan:2015-12/{X}`
        * E.g `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:page:product1:timeSpan:2015-12/2`

* Traffic per Source ({source} is one of: google, Facebook, email, direct, referral, none):

        * E.g `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:source:referral:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * X week of December: `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:source:{source}:timeSpan:2015-12/{X}`
        * E.g `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:source:google:timeSpan:2015-12/1`

* Trend traffic ({page} is one of: homepage, product1, product2, product3):
    * December: from `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:{page}:timeSpan:2015-12-01` to `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:{page}:timeSpan:2015-12-31`
    * 1 Week of December: Similar as above, but from 2015-12-01 to 2015-12-07
    * 2 Week of December: Similar as above, but from 2015-12-08 to 2015-12-14
    * 3 Week of December: Similar as above, but from 2015-12-15 to 2015-12-21
    * 4 Week of December: Similar as above, but from 2015-12-22 to 2015-12-28
    * 5 Week of December: Similar as above, but from 2015-12-29 to 2015-12-31
        * E.g `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:homepage:timeSpan:2015-12-29` => `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:homepage:timeSpan:2015-12-30` => `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:visit:homepage:timeSpan:2015-12-31`

* Total products bought:
    * December: `GET rab:count:action:buy:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * X week of December: `GET rab:count:action:buy:timeSpan:2015-12/{X}`
        * E.g `GET rab:count:action:buy:timeSpan:2015-12/1`

* Total products added to cart:
    * December: `GET rab:count:action:addToCart:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * X week of December: `GET rab:count:action:addToCart:timeSpan:2015-12/{X}`
        * E.g `GET rab:count:action:addToCart:timeSpan:2015-12/1`

* Shares of products bought ({productPage} is on of product1, product2, product3):
    * December: `GET rab:count:action:buy:page:{productPage}:timeSpan:2015-12`
        * E.g `GET rab:count:action:buy:page:product3:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * X week of December: `GET rab:count:action:buy:page:{productPage}:timeSpan:2015-12/{X}`
        * E.g `GET rab:count:action:buy:page:product1:timeSpan:2015-12/2`

* Customer and Cohort Analysis:
    * People who registered: `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:action:register:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * People who register then bought (order matters): `BITCOUNT rab:bitmap:custom:cohort-buy:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * Dropoff: (People who register then bought / People who register) * 100 [%]

* Customers who bought only specified product ({productPage} is one of: product1, product2, product3): `SMEMBERS rab:set:action:buy:page:{productPage}:timeSpan:2015-12`
    * E.g `SMEMBERS rab:set:action:buy:page:product2:timeSpan:2015-12`
* Customers who bought Product1 and Product2: `SINTER rab:set:action:buy:page:product1:timeSpan:anytime rab:set:action:buy:page:product2:timeSpan:anytime`
* Customer Retention (customers who bought on the different dates): `SMEMBERS rab:set:custom:retention-buy:timeSpan:anytime`
